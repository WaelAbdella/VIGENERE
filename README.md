# VIGENERE
This is my Vigenère cipher cracking code just upload any txt file and it will create a txt file that has the original message from the cipher and give you the key length and key 

in this current there is a pre-made Vigenère cipher and my code reads it and cracks it using an analysis repeated characters and creates a shortlist of the key positions.
afterwards it does another analysis and starts assigning the most common repeated letters using the equivelent in the english language.

for the sake of redundancy and for anomalies i cross check my final product with a dictionary, words that are not found in the dictionary will be replaced with whichever
is the cloest equivelent and the replaced letter is then replaced in they key.
